# The reconstruction of causal networks in physiology

*Code* is written in python. You find it in the base directory.
Raw *input data* (e.g. the polysomnography data) is stored in the 'data' directory. We only publish one dataset of each group. If you want to get the remaining datasets, please contact mo.guenther@web.de.
Any *data that is generated* from the scripts is stored in the 'csv' directory.
All *plots* go to the 'plots' directory.

##  About the files
### PART A: G causality vs PRSA
- Fig. 1 needs no data
(more detailed information in the doc strings of each file)
- test_systematic_prsa_vs_G_causality.py generates the data for Fig. 2
- test_G_causality_x1x2.py generates the data for Fig. 3
They are independent of each other

### PART B: Sleep data
(more detailed information in the doc strings of each file)
- preprocess_sleep_data.py takes the raw input data and converts it to timeseries of 1Hz resolution, which are stored to csv/timeseries_resampled
- process_sleep_data.py takes these time series and computes the G values from them
- process_G_df.py uses these G values, puts them together, computes weighted averages and errors from bootstrap; this is the basis for Fig. 5, 6, 7

### Figures
- plots.py generates all plots, based on the data generated by the previous scripts
